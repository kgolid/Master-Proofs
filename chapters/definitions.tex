\section{Definitions}
\label{sec:Definitions}
We define a simple digraph $G = (V,E)$ where $V$ is the set of nodes and $E \subseteq V \times V$ is the set of edges between the nodes.
Since the graph is simple, we define our edges purely in terms of their source and target nodes.\\

\definition
$E!(x_0, x_1)$ holds for the two nodes $x_0,x_1 \in V$ iff
