\section{Main Theorem}
\label{sec:Main Theorem}
\begin{theorem}
  Any binary NAND $\overline{ab}$ proved in the refutation system using only binary NANDs corresponds to one of the following vels in the graph model: $V(a,a)$, $V(a,b)$ or $V(b,b)$.
\end{theorem}
We will prove this fact by induction on the (length of the) proof.
